work, not derived from any engine that came before it. However, it does
use a lot of concepts which are well-known and are in use by most if not
all classical alpha/beta-based chess engines.

// It makes it very easy to make a backup of the game state during make(), and
// restore it when performing unmake(). It prevents having to backup and restore
