## ? ??, 2021 - Rustic Alpha 3.0.0

- New features:
  - Killer Moves
  - Principal Variation Search (PVS)
- Changes:
  - Switch versioning scheme to SemVer. Versions are going to be in the

    - Increment **a**: A new strength-gaining feature was added.
    - Increment **b**: A bug was fixed that gained strength.
    - Increment **c**: A feature was added or a bug was fixed that did not
      gain stregnth. It is not necessary to test this version for a rating
      change.
- Misc:
  - Updated crossbeam-channel to version 0.5.1

    typing "make" (or "gmake" in MacOS), the Makefile will build all Rustic
    versions for the platform it's being compiled on.
  - Re-add showing the size of the TT and number of threads in About.
